# `paprika-recipes` Python Module

This Python module allows you to interact with recipes from the
[Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) electronic recipe book app.

It's a fork of
[Adam Coddington's module](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/paprika-recipes) updated
for Python 3.13. It also adds support for setting the User-Agent to the Python library.

The CLI won't work unless the proper User-Agent is set by default.
